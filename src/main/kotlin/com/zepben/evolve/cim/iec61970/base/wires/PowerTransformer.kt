/**
 * An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling
 * between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).
 *
 *
 * A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.
 *
 *
 * A power transformer can be modeled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations. A
 * power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.
 *
 *
 * The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage
 * should be used instead.
 *
 * @property vectorGroup Vector group of the transformer for protective relaying, e.g., Dyn1. For unbalanced transformers, this may not be simply
 *                       determined from the constituent winding connections and phase angle displacements.
 *
 *                       The vectorGroup string consists of the following components in the order listed: high voltage winding connection, mid
 *                       voltage winding connection(for three winding transformers), phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11,  low voltage
 *                       winding connection phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11.   The winding connections are D(delta), Y(wye),
 *                       YN(wye with neutral), Z(zigzag), ZN(zigzag with neutral), A(auto transformer). Upper case means the high voltage,
 *                       lower case mid or low.The high voltage winding always has clock position 0 and is not included in the vector group
 *                       string.  Some examples: YNy0(two winding wye to wye with no phase displacement), YNd11(two winding wye to delta with
 *                       330 degrees phase displacement), YNyn0d5(three winding transformer wye with neutral high voltage, wye with neutral mid
 *                       voltage and no phase displacement, delta low voltage with 150 degrees displacement).
 *
 *                       Phase displacement is defined as the angular difference between the phasors representing the voltages between the
 *                       neutral point(real or imaginary) and the corresponding terminals of two windings, a positive sequence voltage system
 *                       being applied to the high-voltage terminals, following each other in alphabetical sequence if they are lettered, or in
 *                       numerical sequence if they are numbered: the phasors are assumed to rotate in a counter-clockwise sense.
 *
 * @property primaryVoltage Holds the primary voltage value for a transformer.
 * @property transformerUtilisation The fraction of the transformerâ€™s normal capacity (nameplate rating) that is in use. It may be expressed as the
 *                                  result of the calculation S/Sn, where S = Load on Transformer (in VA), Sn = Transformer Nameplate Rating (in VA).
 *                                  A value of NaN signifies the data is missing/unknown.
