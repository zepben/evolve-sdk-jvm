:::warning
The API for consuming data from the Evolve data server is currently in alpha and very likely to experience breaking changes 
in the future. Please provide any feedback about this API to [Zepben](www.zepben.com).
:::

The SDK provides a client to request models to a remote data server via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The service and proto 
definitions for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-grpc). An implementation of the consumer 
server is provided with the Evolve platform data services.

When working with models, it is often impractical to load a whole model to a client due to the size of the data. This 
is generally not a problem however, as most use cases only operate on a small subsection of the model at a time. So, the 
consumer API provides the ability to request smaller portions of the model quickly and easily. The other benefit to this
is you can set up many clients in parallel operating on different chunks of the model to reduce the amount of time to
run any analytics you may wish to perform across the whole model.
